    <h2>Why do I see this message?</h2>
    <p>
        You have probably accessed a function to contribute information to MetaGist.
        Contribution of information and the rating of packages is 
        limited to user who can identify themselves. For metagist for identity 
        provider is github.com, because metagist will not have its own user database
        and developer using composer packages will likely have a github account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authentication is required to ensure that any contribution can be linked to an
        existing, validated user and to reduce the risk of receiving false or nonsense
        information.
